# Facial-keypoint-detection-python
A facial keypoint detection project from Udacity Computer Vision Nanodegree program. Uses Pytorch to build a CNN model to identify facial keypoints..

In this project, we will use computer vision techniques and deep learning architectures to build a facial keypoint detection program that takes in any image with faces, and predicts the location of 68 keypoints on each face.

The 68 facial keypoints include points around the eyes, nose, and mouth on a face.
